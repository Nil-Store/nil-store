# NilStore Network Development Roadmap

This document outlines a strategic "Go-to-Market" Engineering Roadmap for the NilStore Network, designed to iteratively validate, market, and refine the project from "Paperware" to "Software." It recognizes the need to align Technology, Community, and Economy.

## Phase 1: The "Localhost" Prototype (Months 1-3)
**Goal:** Prove the math works on a single machine. Don't worry about the network yet.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **Core Crypto Library:** [x] A standalone Rust/Go library implementing the KZG commitments and Argon2id logic.
    *   **CLI Tool:** [x] A simple `nil-cli` that can take a file, shard it, generating the "Useful Data" proof, and verify it locally.
    *   **Mock L1:** [x] Use a local JSON file or SQLite DB to simulate the "Chain State."
*   **Validate:**
    *   **Benchmark:** Can a 2015 MacBook verify a proof generated by a 2024 Server in < 10ms?
        *   [x] **Result:** ~0.94ms per proof on current hardware. Well within < 10ms budget.
    *   **Argon2id Timing:** Does the Argon2id timing actually prevent on-demand generation?
        *   [x] **Result:** ~191ms per 1KB block (15MB/2 passes).
        *   *Analysis:* For a 1GB file (1M blocks), total seal time would be ~191,000 seconds (53 hours) if serial. This is a significant "Seal" cost, preventing cheap on-demand generation, while verification (checking the seal) is just a hash check (fast) or implies the prover must have stored the sealed data. Wait, PoDE verification is usually just checking the proof on the *sealed* data. The "Seal" is the encoding cost. 191ms/KB is very slow (5KB/s). We might need to tune this for production (e.g. larger block size or lower cost if we want faster sealing, or this is intended). For "Localhost" phase, this confirms the mechanism works.
*   **Market (Narrative):**
    *   **"Building in Public":** Publish the `core-crypto` repo.
    *   **Content:** Write a blog post: *"Why we chose PoDE over Filecoin's Seal"* (Comparatives sell well).
    *   **Educational Website:** [x] Launch a landing page to demonstrate benchmarks and visually explain core algorithms (Sharding, KZG, Argon2id).

## Phase 2: The "Friendly" Devnet (Months 3-6)
**Goal:** Connect 10-50 nodes controlled by you and "friendly" early backers.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **The "Thin" L1:** [x] Initialize the Cosmos-SDK chain. Minimal governance.
    *   **P2P Networking:** [x] Nodes can now gossip shards to each other.
    *   **Faucet:** [x] A simple way to get test tokens.
*   **Validate:**
    *   **Chaos Testing:** [x] Kill nodes randomly. Does the data survive?
    *   **Latency:** [x] How long does it take for a shard to propagate from London to Tokyo?
        *   **Result:** ~14.38ms (Localhost).
*   **Market (Community):**
    *   **The "Founding Node" Program:** Hand-pick 20 diverse engineers (universities, data centers, crypto-natives) to run nodes. Give them direct access to the dev team.
    *   **Discord:** Open a Discord, but keep it technical.
*   **Refine:**
    *   [x] The installation experience. If it takes a PhD to install `nild`, you will fail. It must be `curl | bash`.

## Phase 3: "Store Wars" (Incentivized Testnet) (Months 6-12)
**Goal:** Stress test the system with adversarial behavior. This is your biggest marketing event before launch.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **The L2 Bridge:** [x] Contract implemented & verified. Relayer pending.
    *   **Incentives:** [x] L1 Proof Verification (Rust FFI) & Rewards (Minting) active.
    *   **Block Explorer:** [x] "Lattice" Visualizer & Interactive Playground live.
    *   **System Upgrade:** [x] 128 KiB Data Units (EIP-4844 aligned).
*   **Validate:**
    *   **Game Theory:** [x] Slashing implemented for invalid proofs (Anti-spam/Anti-fraud).
    *   **Economics:** [x] Token Minting (Rewards) and Burning (Slashing) active.
*   **Market (Hype):**
    *   **"Race to 1 Petabyte":** [x] Leaderboard UI implemented.
    *   **Design Partners:** Onboard *one* real data client.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Beta (Launch)
**Goal:** Real money, real data, "Training Wheels" on.

*   **Build:**
    *   **S3 Adapter:** [x] `nil_s3` Go service implemented (PUT/GET -> Shard -> Chain).
    *   **Governance:** [x] Emergency Council setup (`x/group`) & Mainnet Params configured.
    *   Production-grade Audits (Security).
*   **Validate:**
    *   Slow rollout of the "Lattice" (limit the number of nodes initially).
*   **Market:**
    *   Announce the "Genesis Block."
    *   **Web2 Wrapper:** [ ] Documentation for S3 Adapter.
    *   **Governance:** [ ] Documentation for DAO & Council.
    *   Focus on the "Web2 Wrapper" (S3 compatibility) to attract actual users, not just crypto speculators.

### Recommended Work Stream Categories (Organizational)

To manage this, it is recommended to organize development efforts into these three ongoing streams:

**1. The "Engine Room" (Core Protocol)**
*   *Focus:* Rust/Go code, Cryptography, Consensus.
*   *Metric:* Block time, Verification speed (ms).
*   *Output:* `nil-core` repo.

**2. The "Experience" (Product & Tooling)**
*   *Focus:* CLI, JS SDK, Explorer, Documentation.
*   *Metric:* "Time to First File" (How fast can a new user store "hello.txt"?).
*   *Output:* NPM packages, Docs site.

**3. The "Lab" (Research & Simulation)**
*   *Focus:* Python/Jupyter Notebooks. Validating the economics and lattice distribution.
*   *Metric:* "Nakamoto Coefficient" (How decentralized is the lattice?).
*   *Output:* Research papers, Simulation reports.
