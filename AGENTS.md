# NilStore Network Development Roadmap

This document outlines a strategic "Go-to-Market" Engineering Roadmap for the NilStore Network, designed to iteratively validate, market, and refine the project from "Paperware" to "Software." It recognizes the need to align Technology, Community, and Economy.

## Phase 1: The "Localhost" Prototype (Months 1-3)
**Goal:** Prove the math works on a single machine. Don't worry about the network yet.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **Core Crypto Library:** [x] A standalone Rust/Go library implementing the KZG commitments and Argon2id logic.
    *   **CLI Tool:** [x] A simple `nil-cli` that can take a file, shard it, generating the "Useful Data" proof, and verify it locally.
    *   **Mock L1:** Don't build Cosmos yet. Use a local JSON file or SQLite DB to simulate the "Chain State."
*   **Validate:**
    *   Can a 2015 MacBook verify a proof generated by a 2024 Server in < 10ms? (Key benchmark).
    *   Does the Argon2id timing actually prevent on-demand generation?
*   **Market (Narrative):**
    *   **"Building in Public":** Publish the `core-crypto` repo.
    *   **Content:** Write a blog post: *"Why we chose PoDE over Filecoin's Seal"* (Comparatives sell well).
*   **Refine:**
    *   Adjust cryptographic parameters (shard sizes, difficulty) based on local benchmarks.

## Phase 2: The "Friendly" Devnet (Months 3-6)
**Goal:** Connect 10-50 nodes controlled by you and "friendly" early backers.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **The "Thin" L1:** Initialize the Cosmos-SDK chain. Minimal governance.
    *   **P2P Networking:** Nodes can now gossip shards to each other.
    *   **Faucet:** A simple way to get test tokens.
*   **Validate:**
    *   **Chaos Testing:** Kill nodes randomly. Does the data survive?
    *   **Latency:** How long does it take for a shard to propagate from London to Tokyo?
*   **Market (Community):**
    *   **The "Founding Node" Program:** Hand-pick 20 diverse engineers (universities, data centers, crypto-natives) to run nodes. Give them direct access to the dev team.
    *   **Discord:** Open a Discord, but keep it technical.
*   **Refine:**
    *   The installation experience. If it takes a PhD to install `nild`, you will fail. It must be `curl | bash`.

## Phase 3: "Store Wars" (Incentivized Testnet) (Months 6-12)
**Goal:** Stress test the system with adversarial behavior. This is your biggest marketing event before launch.

*   **Build (Tech):**
    *   **The L2 Bridge:** Connect the L1 to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
    *   **Incentives:** Automated tracking of uptime and proofs.
    *   **Block Explorer:** A visual map of the "Nil-Lattice" showing where data is living.
*   **Validate:**
    *   **Game Theory:** Offer bounties for breaking the consensus. Can someone fake a proof?
    *   **Economics:** Does the "Burn" mechanism actually function when usage spikes?
*   **Market (Hype):**
    *   **"Race to 1 Petabyte":** A competition where node operators race to store dummy data.
    *   **Leaderboard:** Publicly rank nodes by performance.
    *   **Design Partners:** Onboard *one* real data client (e.g., an AI startup archiving training data) to store real files.
*   **Refine:**
    *   Fix the inevitable consensus bugs and memory leaks that appear at scale.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Beta (Launch)
**Goal:** Real money, real data, "Training Wheels" on.

*   **Build:**
    *   Production-grade Audits (Security).
    *   Governance Modules (DAO).
*   **Validate:**
    *   Slow rollout of the "Lattice" (limit the number of nodes initially).
*   **Market:**
    *   Announce the "Genesis Block."
    *   Focus on the "Web2 Wrapper" (S3 compatibility) to attract actual users, not just crypto speculators.

### Recommended Work Stream Categories (Organizational)

To manage this, it is recommended to organize development efforts into these three ongoing streams:

**1. The "Engine Room" (Core Protocol)**
*   *Focus:* Rust/Go code, Cryptography, Consensus.
*   *Metric:* Block time, Verification speed (ms).
*   *Output:* `nil-core` repo.

**2. The "Experience" (Product & Tooling)**
*   *Focus:* CLI, JS SDK, Explorer, Documentation.
*   *Metric:* "Time to First File" (How fast can a new user store "hello.txt"?).
*   *Output:* NPM packages, Docs site.

**3. The "Lab" (Research & Simulation)**
*   *Focus:* Python/Jupyter Notebooks. Validating the economics and lattice distribution.
*   *Metric:* "Nakamoto Coefficient" (How decentralized is the lattice?).
*   *Output:* Research papers, Simulation reports.
