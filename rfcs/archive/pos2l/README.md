# PoS²‑L (Archived Research)

These documents are **research-only** and **non-normative**. They describe historical experiments around “sealed”/timed-derivation proof paths (PoUD/PoDE, Argon2id scaffolds, etc.) that are **not** part of the current devnet/testnet protocol definition.

Canonical protocol documentation:
- `spec.md`
- `rfcs/` (non-archived RFCs)

Contents:
- `PoS2L_scaffold_v1.final.md`: consolidated scaffold/runbook snapshot.
- `PoS2L_research_annex.v1.md`: extended annex notes.
- `PoS2L_scaffold_v1.md`, `PoS2L_scaffold_v1.updated.md`: intermediate drafts retained for historical context.
